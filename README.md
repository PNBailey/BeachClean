# BeachClean
Inspired by our love for keeping our beaches clean, I created this application which allows users to create and search for beach cleaning events. Incorporating the Cloudinary 3rd party API allows users to upload images. Users can add other users as friends and can also like users. Built using Angular, CSS, HTML, .NET Web API and a SQL back end.
